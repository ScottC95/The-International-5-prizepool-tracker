# The-International-5-prizepool-tracker
###What it is
This is an extension for Google Chrome that displays the prize pool details of The International 5 DotA 2 event 

###What i am using
I am using this api to get the latest information about The International - http://www.pradneshpatil.com/dota2.php

###Why am i doing this
I am building this due as this is a much more effiecient way of checking the current prize pool at a quick glance than going to 
[Valves website](http://www.dota2.com/international/compendium/) or a third party website.
