# The International-5 prize pool tracker
###What is it? 
This is an extension for Google Chrome that displays the prize pool details of The International 5 DotA 2 event.


The extension can be found [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ti5-prize-pool-tracker/fhcpapiijbekfnfjlhdplljkfoigmgpp). I would be very happy to recieve any feedback that you may have. 

###What i am using
I am using this api to get the latest information about The International - http://www.pradneshpatil.com/dota2.php

###Why am i doing this
I am building this due as this is a much more effiecient way of checking the current prize pool at a quick glance than going to 
[Valves website](http://www.dota2.com/international/compendium/) or a third party website.
